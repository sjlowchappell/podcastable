Podcastable is my first React project, and I am very happy with the way it turned out! I built this application in my JavaScript class after previously only building one other JQuery project. It was also my first time working with APIs in a project. It gave me a great chance to learn how to properly make API calls, utilize async and await, conditionally render information on the page, and get my first 'interesting' project out there. After letting it rest for a few months, working on other projects and further developing my skills, I returned to Podcastable and broke the App into smaller components. I also broke the styling into CSS modules.

I got excellent feedback on this project from fellow developers Ryan Christiani and from Jenny Ngo which I was able to implement to improve user experience and accessibility.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
